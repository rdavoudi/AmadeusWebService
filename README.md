<b>Using Amadeus web service to book a flight</b> <br/>
As you may know, Amadeus is top 1 online flight booking system in the world. Amadeus has changed the API's protocol from SOAP to Rest. <br />
So, I've decided to share my current implementation for SOAP protocol. <br/>
It will not work in the near future due to changing the protocol but the good news is the View Models hasn't been changed. <br />
You can get an idea about how you can implement your own end user apps. <br />
If you have any idea don't hesitate to share with me.
