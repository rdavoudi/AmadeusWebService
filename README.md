<b>Using Amadeus web service to book a flight</b> <br/>
As you may know, Amadeus is in the world's top 1 online flight booking system. Amadeus has changed the API's protocol from SOAP to Rest. <br />
So, I've decided to share my current implementation of the SOAP protocol. <br/>
It will not work in the near future due to changing the protocol but the good news is the View Models haven't been changed. <br />
You can get an idea about how you can implement your own end-user apps. <br />
If you have any ideas don't hesitate to share them with me.
